# Glaucoma-Detection-System
Glaucoma Detection System
Overview

This is an AI-powered web application for Glaucoma detection using Retinex-enhanced fundus images and an optimized CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. The system helps in early-stage diagnosis by analyzing retinal images and predicting whether a patient has glaucoma.
Features

âœ” Deep Learning-based Glaucoma Detection using TensorFlow/Keras
âœ” Retinex Image Enhancement for better feature extraction
âœ” Web-based Interface built with Flask/Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
âœ” Real-time Image Upload & Analysis
âœ” Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity
Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: Flask/Django
    Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
    Database: SQLite/MySQL
    Cloud Deployment (Optional): AWS/GCP
